# Demo_TraSSI_ICSOC

To simplify the task for researchers in reproducing our TraSSI solution, we have chosen to rely on online tools that avoid the need for complex local installations.

- For ZoKrates, instead of requiring users to manually install and configure the system, we utilize the ZoKrates Plugin within the Ethereum Remix online IDE, offering a more convenient and seamless way to interact with the tool.

- For FHE computations, the Python scripts are available and ready to run directly through a Colab link, provided in a ".pynb" notebook format. This approach ensures easy execution and accessibility, significantly reducing installation barriers and streamlining the reproduction process for researchers.
